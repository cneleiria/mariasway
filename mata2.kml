Frei Gaspar do Casal, e sob a responsabilidade do Arquiteto Afonso Álvares. As obras ficaram concluídas em 1574, ano em que nasceu o Poeta Francisco Rodrigues Lobo. Apresentando uma arquitetura algo severa, de estilo maneirista e barroco, este imponente templo filia-se nas igrejas-de-salão como as sés de Portalegre e Miranda do Douro. A personagem de Eça de Queiroz, o Padre Amaro era o seu pároco e queixava-se do seu estilo frio e jesuítico. O Poeta Acácio de Paiva foi aqui batizado, brincou quando criança no adro e celebrou na Sé o seu casamento com D. Constança Correia.]]></description>
